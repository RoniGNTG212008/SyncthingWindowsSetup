<A name="HP"><B>HOW TO PLAY</B> <A href="#top">[back to top]</A></A>
</P>

<P><A name="HP/I"><B>Introduction</B></A></P>
<P>Feed fish! Fight aliens! This spectacular action-puzzle adventure is the craziest aquarium you’ve ever seen! Buy fish, win pets, and unlock lots of hidden secrets while you explore this captivating underwater world. Then stock your Virtual Tank with custom fish to create your own private screensaver!</P>
<P>As a new player, you start with Adventure mode to earn pets and unlock tanks, then move on to Time Trial mode and, once you are an expert, Challenge mode! You can play Virtual Tank any time, but if you want to spend more than the 200 shells you are given, you'll want to earn shells in the other modes.</P>
<P><A name="HP/CP"><B>Create Your Profile</B></A></P>
<P>When you first launch Insaniquarium Deluxe, you will be asked for your name. Your progress and high scores will be saved when you quit. If there are several people playing on one computer, you will want to create separate profiles for each person. To do this, click on the link at the top of the screen that reads, "If this is not you, click here." A dialog will appear allowing you to select another identity or create a new one.</P>
<P><A name="HP/GC"><B>Game Controls</B></A></P>
<P>Click in the fish tank to drop food for your fish to eat. As the fish eat and grow they will drop coins, and new fish and upgrades become available. When aliens appear, click on them to shoot them with your laser weapon. You can click next to an alien to deflect it in the opposite direction. For example, if you click just above an alien, it will start moving lower. Use this trick to maneuver the aliens away from your fish!</P>
<P><A name="HP/O"><B>Objective</B></A></P>
<P>Your objective in each level of Insaniquarium is to collect enough money to buy 3 egg pieces. When you have purchased all three egg pieces, you will be rewarded with a new pet to add to your collection. To earn money, buy and feed fish so they will grow and drop money. Bigger fish drop more valuable coins. Click on the coins, gems, or other valuable items your fish drop. Watch out for aliens, who appear from time to time to eat your fish. Use the money you collect to buy new guppies, fish food upgrades, weapon upgrades and other items to help you win the level faster.</P>
<P><A name="HP/OM"><B>Options Menu</B></A></P>
<P>The Options Menu is accessible from the first Main Menu screen, or by clicking the Menu button while playing the game. They include:
<UL>
	<LI><B>Music Volume and Sound Effects:</B> you can adjust these volume sliders separately to fit your preferences.</LI>
	<LI><B>Fullscreen:</B> If this is checked, Insaniquarium Deluxe will use your entire computer screen. If it is not checked, Insaniquarium Deluxe will be played in a window. It’s up to you to decide which you prefer.</LI>
	<LI><B>Custom Cursors:</B> If this box is checked, you will see special custom Insaniquarium Deluxe cursors in the game rather than Windows standard cursors. If you have a special theme installed that changes your Windows cursors, you may need to activate this option to see the cursor properly in the game.</LI>
	<LI><B>Hardware Acceleration:</B> This box can be checked to improve performance for computers with supported video cards.</LI>
	<LI><B>Help:</B> This will show you basic instructions on how to play Insaniquarium Deluxe. 
</UL></P>
<P><A name="HP/A"><B>Adventure</B></A></P>
<P>Adventure mode is the first mode you will play. There are four tanks; Each one has different fish and aliens, and each requires the player to adopt new strategies to win.</P>
<P>Each tank is comprised of five levels.  To beat a level, you need to buy three egg pieces (click on last icon in the top row to buy an egg piece). When you buy three egg pieces, a new pet will hatch. You can only have up to three pets to help you on a given level, so once you have discovered more than three pets, you will need to choose your best three before each level begins.</P>
<P>Each pet has different skills that can help you, and some are more suited for certain situations. If you are having a hard time beating a level, experiment with different pet combinations to see which pet combo works best.</P>
<P><A name="HP/BR"><B>Bonus Rounds</B></A></P>
<P>During a Bonus Round, lots of shells will drop - click on them and collect as many as you can before time runs out.  If you click on multiple shells of the same type in a row, you will earn successively more shells for each click. Use the shells you collect to buy the Bonus Pets, fish from the Virtual Tank store, and other upgrades. The first time you play Adventure mode, you will get to play 3 Bonus Rounds. When you have finished Adventure mode, it becomes Bonus Adventure mode, with bonus rounds after each level.</P>
<P><A name="HP/TT"><B>Time Trial</B></A></P>
<P>Once you have completed a tank in Adventure mode, that tank becomes unlocked in Time Trial mode. The objective in Time Trial is to collect as much money as you can in a fixed amount of time. Each tank is limited to 10 minutes, except Tank 1 which has a 5-minute time limit. The pets and strategy you choose for each tank will have a big effect on how much money you can collect. Choose pets that will help you get money quickly during the early part of the game, as this will allow you to upgrade to higher paying fish faster.</P>
<P>There are no egg pieces to buy in Time Trial mode, but you can buy extra pets to help you. The pets you buy will be randomly chosen, so if you want to risk it, you can spend some of your hard earned money to buy helper pets during the level. You can only buy pets you have already discovered in Adventure mode, but aside from that, you can buy as many pets as you want to help you out. Just keep in mind that they start getting very expensive.</P>
<P>As a bonus for each time you complete a Time Trial tank, you are awarded shells equal to 5% of the money you have when the time runs out.</P>
<P><A name="HP/CH"><B>Challenge</B></A></P>
<P>Challenge mode is not for the weak of heart and is only unlocked once you have finished Adventure mode. Challenge mode has four tanks, each one progressively harder. The objective of Challenge mode is to finish each tank as fast as you can, while at the same time trying to deal with increasingly difficult alien attacks, and rising prices!</P>
<P>The prices of all items begin to rise as soon as they become available, and keep on rising. When you buy an egg piece, all prices will reset to their starting levels, except the price of the egg pieces, which keep rising till you buy all three egg pieces to complete the level.</P>
<P>Try to finish as quickly as possible, because the alien attacks will become more ferocious as time goes on.</P>
<P>You are rewarded with shells each time you finish a Challenge tank. You get 2,000 shells each time you complete Challenge tank 1; 5,000 for tank 2; 10,000 for tank 3; and a whopping 20,000 for tank 4.</P>
<P><A name="HP/VT"><B>Virtual Tank</B></A></P>
<P>The Insaniquarium Virtual Tank is your own personal aquarium. The first thing you should do is go to the Store, where you can buy fish, tank upgrades, and new backdrops. You are given 200 shells to begin with, and you can earn more as you play the other three game modes.</P>
<P>Fish you buy in the Virtual Tank will never die, but you should feed them to keep them happy. A fish requires three pieces of food per day to stay completely happy. Many fish eat normal fish food, which you can drop by clicking in the tank. But some fish, such as Carnivores and fish with 'special diets,' must be fed by clicking on the Feed button.</P>
<P>If you buy a fish and decide you would rather spend your shells on something else, you can always sell it. Click on the Fish button, select the fish you want to sell, and then click Sell. If you sell a fish on the same day you buy it, you get a full refund. After that, the resale value will be lower.</P>
<P>At the top of the Virtual Tank screen is a bar with several important buttons.
<UL>
	<LI><B>Store:</B> This takes you to the Fish Emporium, where you can buy fish and other goodies for your tank.</LI>
	<LI><B>Fish:</B> Click the Fish button to manage your fish collection. Here you can rename or sell fish, hide fish if your tank is getting too crowded, or even find out more about each fish you own, such as their mood, hometown, and hobbies.</LI>
	<LI><B>Pets:</B> You can also add your pets to your Virtual Tank by clicking the Pets button.</LI>
	<LI><B>Feed:</B> This button only shows up if you have fish that don't eat normal fish food. This allows you to feed these fish. To feed regular fish, just click in the tank to drop food.</LI>
	<LI><B>Tank:</B> Click on the Tank button to change various Virtual Tank settings, such as changing backdrops, turning off fish names, enabling the screensaver, etc.</LI>
</UL></P>
<P><A name="HP/VTO"><B>Virtual Tank Options</B></A></P>
<P>The Virtual Tank options are available from the Tank button inside Virtual Tank mode.</P>
<UL>
	<LI><B>Show Fish Names:</B> By default, the names of the fish in your tank will be displayed underneath each fish. Uncheck this option if you don't want the names displayed.</LI>
	<LI><B>Show Bubbulator:</B> Once you have bought the Bubbulator from the Store, you can hide it any time by un-checking this option.</LI>
	<LI><B>Show Alien Attractor:</B> Once you have bought the Alien Attractor from the Store, you can hide it any time by un-checking this option. Aliens will not appear if the Alien Attractor is hidden.</LI>
	<LI><B>Allow Fish To Drop Shells:</B> Uncheck this box if you do not want your fish to drop shells in Virtual Tank.</LI>
	<LI><B>Always Show When Fish Are Hungry:</B> Fish only need to be fed three pieces of food per day, and after that they will no longer appear hungry till the next day. Check this option if you want your Virtual Tank fish to always display when they are hungry.</LI>
</UL></P>
<P><A name="HP/VTS"><B>Virtual Tank Screensaver</B></A></P>
<P>You can use your Virtual Tank as your computer screensaver. Because Virtual Tank fish drop shells, any shells collected while the screensaver is running will be added to your Shell balance. Make sure you add pets that feed your fish (like Zorf the Seahorse) since hungry fish do not drop shells. And don't forget to add a pet that collects money and shells (like Stinky the Snail), otherwise shells dropped by your fish while the screensaver is running will not be collected.</P>
<P>To set up your Insaniquarium screensaver, click on the Tank button in Virtual Tank and then click the Screensaver... button. Check the box labeled Enable Screensaver and click OK.</P>
<P>There are a few options for the screensaver.
<UL>
	<LI><B>Allow Monitor Powersave Mode:</B> Check this option if you want your keep your monitor powersaving setting enabled while the Insaniquarium screensaver is running. This option is off by default. Some computers, especially older systems, may have problems when this option is enabled. If you enable this option and experience any problems, turn it off or disable your Insaniquarium screensaver.</LI>
	<LI><B>Enable Sound:</B> Check this if you want the sound effects to play while the screensaver is running.</LI>
	<LI><B>Rotate Backdrops:</B> Check this if you want the screensaver to cycle through all the tank backdrops you have purchased in the Store.</LI>
	<LI><B>Periodically Darken Screen:</B> Check this if you want the screensaver to go dark at regular intervals.</LI>
	<LI><B>Show Collected Shells:</B> Check this if you would like the screensaver to display how many shells have been collected while the screensaver has been running.</LI>
</UL></P>
<P>To disable the screensaver from within the game, select Tank options in Virtual Tank, click on Screensaver... and uncheck the Enable Screensaver button.</P>
<P>To disable the screensaver from the Windows Desktop, just perform the following three steps:
<OL>
	<LI>Right-click on a blank area of your Windows Desktop and select 'Properties' to show the Display Properties dialog.</LI>
	<LI>Click on the Screen Saver tab.</LI>
	<LI>From the drop-down list under the 'Screen saver' heading, select a different screensaver or select [NONE], then click OK to confirm the choice.</LI>
</OL>

<P class=header>
<A name="GT"><B>GAMEPLAY TIPS</B> <A href="#top">[back to top]</A></A>
</P>

<P><B>Prego sound:</B> Some people are annoyed by the sound Prego makes when a baby is born. To change this sound, type 'prego' (without the quotes) in any tank and an alternate sound will be played whenever Prego has a baby. Type 'prego' again if you want the old sound back.</LI>
<P><B>Fighting aliens:</B> As soon as an alien appears, try to coax it away from your fish by firing your laser next to it. Clicking to the left of an alien will force it to go to the right, clicking just above an alien will force it to move down.</LI>
<P><B>Alien immune to lasers:</B> One alien is immune to your laser weapon! But, his stomach is his weakness, so use food to get rid of him.</LI>
<P><B>Star Potion:</B> Only large guppies can eat the Star Potion. Small and Medium guppies will die if they eat it. Wait till you see a hungry large guppy, then buy and drop a Star Potion right in front of it to make sure no other fish accidentally eats it. Once a large guppy has eaten a Star Potion, it will drop stars, which the Star Catchers need to stay alive.</LI>
<P><B>Dropping Food:</B> When you have upgraded your food quantity, you can click and hold down your mouse button to auto-feed.</LI>
<P><B>Replaying Insaniquarium:</B> After you have finished the Adventure game, you can replay it and use any of the pets in any level. But if you want to replay the game in order to win all the pets again, you will need to create a new User Profile from the Main Menu. Just click on 'If this is not you, click here' link under the Welcome message and create a new user.</LI>
<P><B>Screensaver Tips:</B> Did you know you can collect shells while your screensaver is running? Just make sure you have the following in your Virtual Tank: some fish to drop shells, a pet that feeds your fish, and a pet that collects shells. You can even see how many shells have been collected while your screensaver is running by enabling 'Show Shells Collected' in Virtual Tank Options.</LI>
<P><B>Time Counter:</B> If you want to see the elapsed time in any Adventure or Challenge tank, just type 'time' and it will be displayed in the lower right corner. Type 'time' again if you want the time display to go away.</LI>
<P><B>Virtual Tank Refund:</B> If you buy a fish in the Virtual Tank Store and don't like it, you can get a full refund if you sell it back on the same day you bought it. Just click on the Fish button in Virtual Tank, select your fish, and click Sell. When you hover your mouse pointer over the sell button, the refund price of the fish will be displayed.</LI>
<P><B>Double-click to hide/show fish:</B> You can quickly hide or show a fish from the Virtual Tank's Fish screen by double-clicking on it.</LI>
<P><B>Having a hard time in Challenge?</B> Challenge mode can be very difficult, and the key to winning is choosing the right combination of pets, defending against the aliens, and making sure you get as much money as quickly as possible. This will enable you to buy the more expensive options faster. If you are close to buying an egg piece, try to put off purchasing fish or upgrades for a short while, since all prices get reset as soon as you purchase an egg piece (except the price of the egg pieces, which continues to rise).  Challenge tanks 3 and 4 are very tricky and you may need to buy and use some or all of the Bonus Pets to help you win.</LI>
<P><B>Bonus Round Tip:</B> You can get extra points for consecutively clicking on the same type of shell. This is useful when you see a lot of the same shell type on the screen, especially the more valuable shells.</LI>
<P><B>Need Shells?</B> You can earn shells in a variety of ways. Shells can be collected during the Bonus Rounds in Adventure mode, shells are awarded after each Time Trial and Challenge game, the fish you buy in your Virtual Tank drop shells, even when the screensaver is running (as long as you have feeding and shell-collecting pets in your tank).</LI>
<P><B>Scaring fish:</B> Right-clicking on your Virtual Tank can scare some of the fish. You don't want to do that, do you?</LI>
<P><B>Challenge mode:</B> In the Challenge tanks, alien attacks get more ferocious the longer you play, so try to finish each tank as quickly as possible.</LI>
<P><B>PsychoSquid tip:</B> Stop shooting PsychoSquid when he is blue, otherwise he will regain health. Use that time to coax him away from your fish by shooting next to him.</LI>
<P><B>Transferring Shells:</B> If you have collected more shells than you can possibly spend, you can give them to another user!  At the Main Menu, type 'give' (without the quotes) and you will see a dialog listing all the other Insaniquarium user profiles that have been created on your computer. Click on the user you want to give shells to, then enter how many shells you want to transfer. Click OK to finalize the transfer.  You can create a new user profile from the Main Menu by clicking on 'If this is not you, click here'. By creating an extra profile, you can quickly start a new Virtual Tank using shells you have transferred from another profile.</P>
